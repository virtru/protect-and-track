# Deploy using gitflow
#
# Basic idea:
# * Developers almost always push to main first.
# * Releases happen on a branch
# * They can cherry-pick (or ffwd-merge, aka no-fault rebase) to releases
# * Once a release goes out it is tagged. Tags are on releases, these may or
#   may not be in a history.
#
# Where do deployments go:
# main -> develop01
# feature/* -> develop[X] after select
# release/* -> staging
# v* -> production after block & shout
